        <p>It is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since their composition four hundred years ago,
            Shakespeare’s plays and poems have traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to make
            them their own.</p>
        <p>Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process of “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our
            own thoughts and feelings in language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason, new. We
            still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a mile a minute, whose words paint pictures that
            shift like clouds. These expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource for study, artistic
            adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic texts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic
            form as Folger Digital Texts, we place a trusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.</p>
        <p>The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis for the texts realized here in digital
            form, are special because of their origin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the single
            greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An unparalleled collection of early modern books,
            manuscripts, and artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been consulted extensively in
            the preparation of these texts. The Editions also reflect the expertise gained through the regular
            performance of Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theater.</p>
        <p>I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine for creating these indispensable
            editions of Shakespeare’s works, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a richness of
            commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers who want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays
            can follow the paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the Folger either in-person or
            online, where a range of physical and digital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I
            commend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.</p>
